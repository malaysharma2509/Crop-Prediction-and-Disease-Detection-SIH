AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection and Prediction Platform
Project Overview
This platform leverages machine learning to assist farmers and gardeners in identifying crop diseases through image analysis, predicting disease outbreaks, and providing actionable insights for disease prevention and treatment. Additionally, it suggests optimal crops for cultivation based on environmental data, helping improve yield and resistance to diseases.

Key Features
AI-Powered Image Analysis: Detects and classifies crop diseases from uploaded images using CNN-based models.
Predictive Analytics: Forecasts potential disease outbreaks using historical and real-time environmental data.
Actionable Insights: Offers tailored treatment suggestions and preventive measures based on diagnosis and risk assessment.
Crop Suggestion: Recommends the best crops for specific environmental conditions (e.g., rainfall, temperature, humidity, soil composition) to maximize yield and disease resistance.
Web-Based Interface: User-friendly platform for uploading images, viewing disease reports, and receiving recommendations.
Technologies Used
Backend: Flask (web framework)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap (for responsive design)
Machine Learning: TensorFlow & Keras (CNN model for disease detection)
Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation), Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)
Development Methodology
Design: System requirements and architecture definition.
Data Collection: Gathering and preprocessing crop images and environmental data.
Model Development: Training CNN models for disease detection and additional models (e.g., Random Forest) to validate accuracy. Developing predictive models for disease risk assessment.
Backend Development: Implementing a Flask server for processing and API development.
Frontend Development: Building a web interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
Integration: Linking frontend, backend, and machine learning models.
Testing: Validating the accuracy and functionality of models and the entire system.
Deployment: Deploying the web application on a cloud platform.
Maintenance: Monitoring system performance and updating models as needed.
Purpose
Our goal is to assist farmers and kitchen gardeners in:

Predicting the best crops for their fields using environmental factors such as soil pH and moisture.
Detecting plant diseases through image uploads and providing effective treatment suggestions via our web platform.
